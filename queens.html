		to be named after our favorite musicians, though we have been known to get
		more creative. FOr examply, “19-33” is our address, and coincidentally, the
		year prohibition ended.”.</p>

		<p class="bodytxt">What Sara Says: 19-33 is SingleCut's flagship pilsner,
		described as a Czech/German Pilsner mashup brewed with authentic ingredients
		from both regions. For a pilsner, this beer was very full bodied with a wide
		variety of flavors. The hop was a little stonger than I expected for a
		pilsner and it has a pretty pronounced earthy/spicy quality. My biggest 
		qualm is that the head dissipated almost immediately. Overall, it is an 
		enjoyable pilsner with a little more pizzaz than 		your standard light 
		beer. It's refreshing for a hot summer's day and I would 
		definitely enjoy it again.</p>
