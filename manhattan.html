		<p class="bodytxt">Tina Says: When you pour into the glass this brew is a deep golden with a small frothy foam in a off white head that disappeared almost immediately. This beer is full bodied (more than I enjoy in the Summer) but not too heavy.  Described by the brewer as refreshing and tasty Belgian style wheat ale, I would consider that a a bold description but not completely inaccurate.  This beer was slightly sweet with a citrus fruit and honey flavor.  I'm also guessing that there is some cinnamon or cardamon in the mix somewhere.  The aftertaste is a slightly dry and a bit bitter.  My overall review is that it is definitely drinkable but Harlem deserves better.</p>
